# GoValve-Root-src

This repository provides code for computing aortic root strain over the cardiac cycle from a 4D medical image series (e.g., transesophageal echocardiography). 
The algorithm is implemented as a freely available distributed segmentation service (GoValve-Root) in ITK-SNAP. 

Documentation for GoValve-Root can be found here:
